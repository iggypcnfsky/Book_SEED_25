# Location Profile: Oaxacan Jungle (Uncharted Region)

## Basic Information
- **Name:** Uncharted Oaxacan Jungle / The Forgotten Path
- **Role:** Initial setting, physical barrier, zone of isolation (Book 1, Chapter 1)

## Physical Description
- **Atmosphere:** Thick, heavy, humid, soupy air. Oppressive heat.
- **Vegetation:** Dense, tangled green hell. Defiant vines requiring machete work. Massive ceiba trees with buttressed roots. Broad, waxy leaves. Thick moss.
- **Terrain:** Steep ascents, muddy banks, exposed roots, series of jungle-choked bluffs marking the approach to the temple.
- **Fauna:** Constant thrum/buzz of insects (mosquitoes). Distant screeches of unseen birds. Rustling indicating lizards, snakes, coatimundis, or possibly jaguars.

## Sensory Details
- **Sounds:** Muted sounds, watchful quiet broken by buzzing, screeches, rustling, machete whacks. Lack of normal jungle cacophony closer to the temple.
- **Smells:** Damp earth, decaying vegetation.
- **Feel:** Oppressive heat, clinging humidity, physical exertion, isolation, mosquito bites.

## Atmosphere & Mood
- Watchful, ancient, vast, indifferent to human survival.
- Oppressive, energy-sapping, monotonous (cycle of hacking/hiking).
- Isolated, unnerving (sense of being observed).
- Increasingly strange closer to the temple (muted sounds, organised vegetation patterns, low hum felt through boots).

## Significance
- Establishes Alex's isolation, determination, and the physical difficulty of his quest.
- Acts as a natural barrier protecting the hidden temple complex.
- Hints at the unnatural nature of the destination through subtle environmental shifts.

## Key Moments
- Alex navigating via the ancient map and compass.
- The physical struggle (hacking vines, slipping on mud).
- Growing sense of unease and being watched.
- Following the "Forgotten Path" towards the temple.
