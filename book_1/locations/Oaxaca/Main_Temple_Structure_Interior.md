# Location Profile: Main Temple Structure (Interior)

## Basic Information
- **Name:** Main Temple Structure (unofficial)
- **Role:** Heart of the complex, repository of glyphs and potential information (Book 1, Chapter 3)

## Physical Description
- **Entrance:** Perfect, arching void in black stone. Darker than shadow. Exudes cold air, scent of dust and ozone/static.
- **Materials:** Same seamless, black, light-absorbing stone as exterior. Feels like polished glass. Extremely durable.
- **Architecture:** Continues non-Euclidean geometry. Corridors curve downwards. Floors dip unexpectedly. Disorienting angles. Large central chamber with high, vaulted ceiling lost in shadow.
- **Atmosphere:** Still, cold, unnaturally dry air. No dust motes. Feels ancient, preserved, static.
- **Illumination:** Primarily from faint, internally luminescent Seed glyphs embedded in walls/floor. Flashlight beams are dampened/absorbed.

## Sensory Details
- **Sounds:** Exterior jungle hum silenced upon entry. Replaced by deeper, clearer internal vibration/hum, strongest in central chamber. Felt physically.
- **Visuals:** Near-darkness broken by glowing glyphs. Intricate, non-representational carvings (spirals, fractals, geometric shapes) cover surfaces, seeming to shift in dim light. Light-absorbing stone.
- **Feel:** Cold, smooth stone. Deep vibration through floor. Palpable pressure/energy in central chamber. Warmth from central glyph material.
- **Smells:** Dust, ozone/static (especially near entrance).

## Atmosphere & Mood
- Alien, ancient, tomb-like yet humming with energy.
- Disorienting, potentially hostile (geometry traps, darkness).
- Profound, significant, evoking primal familiarity/unease (especially near central glyph).
- Sense of contained power, vast knowledge, waiting presence.

## Significance
- Introduces the interior environment and its unique properties.
- Reveals the extensive use and significance of the Seed glyph within the structure.
- Hints at the structure's purpose (repository of information, energy source?).
- Provides the first concrete clue beyond the symbol itself (star map).

## Key Moments
- Alex entering the void-like entrance.
- Experiencing the sensory shift (sound, air, light).
- Discovering the intricate carvings and ubiquitous glowing glyphs.
- Flashlight failing, increasing reliance on glyph-light.
- Falling due to disorienting geometry/dip in floor.
- Reaching the central chamber with the large, pulsing glyph.
- Experiencing the profound/unsettling effect of the central glyph.
- Touching the glyph, causing it to flare.
- Seeing the unknown star map reflected on the ceiling (cliffhanger).
