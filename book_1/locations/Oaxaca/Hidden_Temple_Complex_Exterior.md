# Location Profile: Hidden Temple Complex (Exterior)

## Basic Information
- **Name:** Hidden Temple Complex / Temple of Whispers (unofficial)
- **Role:** Site of initial discovery, revelation of impossible architecture (Book 1, Chapter 2)

## Physical Description
- **Materials:** Seamless, black, light-absorbing stone. Feels cool, impossibly smooth like polished obsidian. Impervious to scratches (tested with machete). No tool marks or seams.
- **Architecture:** Non-Euclidean geometry. Walls curve and angle unexpectedly. Lines seem to shift. Corners aren't true 90 degrees. Arches lean impossibly. Structures (towers, platforms, walls) cluster around a larger central edifice.
- **Preservation:** Impossibly perfect. No decay, crumbling, or significant jungle reclamation beyond surface moss/epiphytes. Fused with the landscape (earth, tree roots, rock outcrops) rather than built upon it.
- **Clearing:** A wide, circular clearing surrounds the central structure, with the jungle forming a near-perfect boundary.

## Sensory Details
- **Sounds:** A low, pervasive hum or vibration, felt in bones/teeth, intensifies closer to structures and especially the central one. Seems to emanate from the stone itself.
- **Visuals:** Dim green light filtered through canopy. Stone absorbs light. Unsettling, disorienting geometry. Glimpses of multiple structures through foliage.
- **Feel:** Cool stone. Low vibration. Disorientation/vertigo triggered by proximity/hum/geometry.

## Atmosphere & Mood
- Ancient, alien, impossible, disorienting.
- Sense of preserved stillness, untouched by time/jungle.
- Watchful, potentially hostile (disorienting effects, feeling of trespass).
- Overwhelming sense of scale and mystery.

## Significance
- Confirms Alex's fringe theories and the map's validity.
- Establishes the non-human/impossibly ancient origin of the site.
- Introduces the strange physical properties (material, geometry, hum) associated with the Seed technology/builders.
- Presents a major paradigm shift for Alex.

## Key Moments
- Alex discovering the first black stone wall.
- Realizing the scale - an entire complex.
- Observing the impossible geometry and preservation.
- Experiencing the disorienting hum and vertigo (leading to fall/injury).
- Approaching the main central structure.
- Discovering the glowing Seed glyph at the entrance (cliffhanger transition to Ch 3).
