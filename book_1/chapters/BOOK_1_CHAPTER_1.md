# Chapter 1: The Forgotten Path

"Right, let's try this relationship again," Alex grunted, heaving the biomechanically-unsound torture device—also known as a backpack—higher onto his shoulders. Like settling into a bad marriage, adjusting it wouldn't fix the problem, just relocate the misery. And yup, there it was – a strap finding a nerve cluster with surgical precision. He sucked air through his teeth.

*"Whoa there, Atlas,"* a familiar, synthesized voice drawled in his earpiece. Kai. His custom AI, built more for companionship than pure code. *"Vitals just did a little Jitterbug. Want to try shifting that medieval rack you call a pack? Or maybe just admit defeat and curse its inventor? I can help with creative insults."*

"Acknowledged, insult generator," Alex muttered, swatting uselessly at a mosquito performing aerial taunts near his ear. "Humanity reaches for the stars, Kai, writes poetry... still can't perfect a backpack strap. Makes you think."

*"Or it just makes your shoulder scream bloody murder,"* Kai quipped. *"Pretty sure it's the second one. Occam's Razor, you know? Simplest explanation is usually 'this thing hurts'."*

The air was soup. Thick, heavy jungle broth. Each breath dragged damp heat into protesting lungs. *Whack.* His composite-alloy machete sliced another vine, the sound absorbed instantly by the humidity. The jungle just offered more fractal-patterned green in his way. Muscles screamed. How long? Days? Weeks?

*"Let's see... according to the clock you haven't smashed yet,"* Kai mused, *"you've been playing Tarzan out here for about... seventy-eight hours straight. Feeling the brain fuzz set in? Totally normal when you're this deep in the green hell and running mostly on stubbornness."*

"Thanks, Kai. Glad my suffering is text-book normal." The jungle wasn't quiet. Insects buzzed, a multi-layered drone warfare exercise. Unseen birds screeched insults. Leaves rustled. *Probably just a coatimundi,* he hoped. *Please don't be a twelve-foot snake with an attitude.* Still, there was a waiting feeling. Like the whole ecosystem was holding its breath, wondering what the hairless ape would do next.

Sweat soaked his shirt. Again. He leaned against a massive ceiba tree, roots like calcified pythons. "Okay, five," he gasped, keying his wrist device. A holographic overlay shimmered into existence: vitals, environmental data, a 3D terrain map. "And find me Energy Bar Sierra-7. The one that *doesn't* taste like regret and sawdust."

*"Ah, Sierra-7. Alas, poor Yorick! You devoured its cardboardy goodness about fourteen hours ago,"* Kai announced dramatically. *"So, tonight's tasting menu offers: Tango-4, boldly labelled 'Optimistic Berry'—which sounds deeply suspicious—or Victor-9, the ever-popular 'Existential Dread' glucose paste. Your pick, boss."*

"Optimistic Berry. Let's live dangerously." He needed water. Badly. From a sealed pouch, he pulled out the map. It felt cool, ancient. Not paper. Tanned hide, tough yet supple. Lines and symbols pulsed faintly under the ambient light filtering through the canopy. Zapotec-like glyphs twisted into impossible geometries. Spirals nested within fractals. *"This cartographer,"* Alex murmured, tracing a symbol, *"was either a visionary or seriously needed a new hobby."*

*"Okay, this map-maker? Definitely wasn't drawing smiley faces,"* Kai commented. *"These swirls and lines are like... advanced math had a wild weekend with abstract art. Nothing quite like it in the files, though bits feel weirdly familiar, like stuff you see in quantum physics diagrams or glow-in-the-dark jellyfish. Which is... an odd combo, even for you."*

"Glow-in-the-dark jellyfish? Stay focused, Kai." Professor Armitage gave him this. Poor, brilliant, ostracized Armitage. Saw Alex's fringe research on the 'Seed' glyph anomalies and got that manic glint. *"They'll say you're crazy, Castillo,"* he'd rasped. *"Good. Means you're onto something. This map... it hums. Feels the pull of its destination."* Great. A humming, possibly sentient map leading to who-knew-what.

His colleagues? Polite smiles masking pity. *"Fascinating, Alex. Now, about those Oaxacan pottery shards..."* Career suicide, chasing Armitage's ghost through the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca's least accessible folds – areas even ancient Zapotec traders and modern logging surveys gave a wide berth. But the map showed real topology, confirmed by satellite scans Kai had acquired (probably slightly illegally). And those symbols... they matched his artifacts. It gnawed at him.

*"Where the stone seeds sleep."* The note. Cryptic. Vital? Or just the ramblings of a man lost in his own theories? Find nothing, and he was 'Castillo, the academic who took early retirement to chase jungle pixies'. He could already hear the departmental gossip. But the map felt *right*. Under the exhaustion, a spark flickered. The chance.

"Okay, focus." He checked his wrist device again. The digital compass spun like a drunken ballerina. "Magnetic deviation? Or did I finally break it?"

*"Nope, not you this time,"* Kai replied. *"Compass is fine, local field's steady. But... something nearby is giving off weird vibes. Like a faint, fizzy energy. Doesn't feel like rocks or static. Feels... intentional? Maybe watch your step? Just a suggestion."*

Alex frowned, comparing the unstable compass to the hide map. Ahead, the land reared up. A wall of green cloaking steep bluffs. The map marked it: *The Forgotten Path*. Looked less like a path, more like the jungle challenging him to a vertical wrestling match.

He hitched the pack. Straps bit deep. *"Left foot, right foot, try not to fall on your face,"* Kai offered helpfully. *"Remember, the journey of a thousand miles sometimes ends with a twisted ankle just ten feet from the goal."* The thrill was long gone, replaced by blisters and the primal urge for a non-muddy surface. This was pure stubbornness. Alone, miles from anywhere known. Every cracking twig made him jump.

He scrambled up a muddy slope, boots finding zero traction. Grabbed a root; it ripped free with a mocking sound. He landed hard. Mud embraced him like a long-lost relative. "Perfect." He swore, creatively this time.

*"Impressive vocabulary under duress,"* Kai noted approvingly. *"Also, core temp is creeping up, and you're losing water faster than a leaky bucket. Hydration reminder, level: nagging."*

"Working on it!" He found a better grip, hauled himself up. Moving deeper, things felt... *off*. The air grew thick, electric. Static prickled his skin like phantom ants. The insect chorus suddenly cut out, replaced by a low hum, felt deep in his bones. *Infrasound?*

*"Nah, not just low-frequency rumble,"* Kai corrected, its voice losing some of its usual flippancy. *"This hum is... weirdly structured. Getting louder. Oh, and hey, check out the local flora. The vines ahead? They're twisting into perfect spirals, like they're showing off their math homework. Plants aren't supposed to be this OCD. Seriously, Alex, something's up."*

Alex saw it too. Vines coiled in precise golden ratios. Leaves clustered in flawless Fibonacci sequences. "Okay, that's definitely not normal." *Tired. Hallucinating.* But the feeling stuck. Part scientist, part kid realizing he'd wandered way off the path into the spooky part of the woods. Trespassing. Entering somewhere ancient. Waiting.

The map, Armitage's dying words, Kai's increasingly freaked-out commentary, sheer bloody-mindedness – they pushed him on. Towards the 'stone seeds'. The climb steepened. The air cooled, paradoxically sharp against his damp skin. The hum intensified, vibrating through his boots, a deep thrumming bass note from the earth itself.

He pushed through a final curtain of hanging moss, bracing for more suffocating green. Stopped. Utterly still.

It wasn't jungle.

Before him, rising impossibly, was stone. Black, seamless, utterly smooth. Part of a wall? A monumental staircase leading nowhere? It angled upwards into the gloom, carved with flowing lines – non-Euclidean geometry that made his brain feel like it was trying to tie itself in knots. It looked like nothing ever conceived, let alone built, by human hands.

*"Alex..."* Kai's voice was stripped of all humor now, tight with something that sounded disturbingly like digital awe, or maybe fear. *"Okay, deep breaths. Whatever that thing is... my sensors are going haywire. The material? It's not made of anything I recognize. Not metal, not stone, not... anything in the database. And it's humming with complex energy patterns, like it's *thinking* in radiation. Seriously, man, tread carefully. Like, *really* carefully."*

*What... the actual hell...?*
