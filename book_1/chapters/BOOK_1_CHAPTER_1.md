# Chapter 1: The Forgotten Path

"Right, let's try this relationship again," Alex grunted, heaving the backpack higher onto his shoulders. Like settling into a bad marriage, he knew adjusting it wouldn't *really* fix the fundamental problem, it would just shift the misery to a new, exciting location on his spine. And yup, there it was – the familiar, surgical precision of a strap finding that one nerve he didn't even know he had until five minutes ago. He sucked air through his teeth. "You know," he confided to a nearby vine that looked particularly judgmental, "humanity spends billions reaching for the stars, building empires, writing poetry... and yet, we still haven't perfected the simple backpack strap. Makes you think." He swatted uselessly at a mosquito performing aerial acrobatics near his ear. "Or maybe it just makes your shoulder hurt."

The air was soup. Thick. Heavy. Like wading through warm broth. Each breath was work, dragging the damp heat into his lungs. *Whack.* His machete sliced another vine. The sound died instantly in the humid air. *Another one bites the dust,* he thought, though the jungle didn't seem impressed. It just threw more green stuff in his way.

Muscles screamed. How long had he been swinging this thing? Days? Weeks? Hard to tell. The jungle swallowed time. It wasn't quiet, not really. Bugs buzzed constantly, like tiny, annoying engines. Weird birds screeched somewhere overhead. Leaves rustled. *Probably just a lizard,* he hoped. *Please don't be a snake.* Still, there was a waiting feeling. Like the whole jungle was holding its breath, watching him.

Sweat soaked his shirt. Again. It wasn't just the hiking; the heat pressed down, stealing his energy. Making him think fuzzy thoughts. He leaned against a huge tree, roots spreading like giant knuckles. *Okay, five minutes,* he told himself. *Just five. And maybe find that last energy bar. The one that doesn't taste like cardboard.* He needed water. Badly. His shoulders felt like they were about to fall off. He wiped his face with a bandana. Useless. More sweat popped out immediately. From a special pouch, zipped tight against the damp, he pulled out the map.

It felt weird. Cool. Old. Not paper. Animal skin, tough but strangely soft. Lines and symbols covered it. Crazy symbols. Some looked a bit like old Zapotec stuff, but twisted. Mixed with sharp shapes, like geometry homework gone wild. Spirals. Triangles inside triangles. Definitely not on the standard pre-Columbian bingo card. *Whoever drew this,* Alex thought, *was either a genius or seriously needed a hobby.*

He poked a spiral symbol. Professor Armitage gave him this map. Poor old Armitage. Everyone at the university thought he was nuts. Talking about lost cities, ancient astronauts, the works. Saw Alex's research notes – the ones about weird patterns in old stones – and got that glint in his eye. *"They'll say you're crazy, Castillo,"* he'd coughed from his bed. *"Good. Means you're onto something. This map... it's calling you."* Great. Just what he needed. A map with his name on it, leading to who-knows-where.

His colleagues? They hated this stuff. Laughed at Armitage. Smiled politely at Alex's 'Seed' glyph theories. *"Fascinating, Alex. Now, about those pottery fragments..."* His career was built on digging careful holes and labeling things neatly. Not chasing ghost stories with a treasure map. But... the map showed real places. Places satellite photos confirmed but nobody had actually explored. And those symbols matched his weird stones. It gnawed at him. *What if the old man wasn't crazy? What if this is real?*

*"Where the stone seeds sleep."* The note with the map said that. Seeds. Sounded important. Maybe. Or maybe just weird. This whole trip was career suicide if he found nothing. He'd be 'Castillo, the guy who got lost looking for magic beans.' He could already hear the snickers back at faculty meetings.

But the map felt *right*. And deep down, under the exhaustion and the bug bites, a little spark of excitement flickered. The chance to prove them all wrong. To find something huge. That spark kept him going. Mostly. That and the dwindling supply of trail mix.

*Okay, focus.* He checked his compass. The needle wobbled. *Great. More jungle weirdness? Or did I drop it again?* He compared it to the map. Yep. Ahead, the land climbed sharply. A wall of green heading up to steep bluffs. The map showed them clearly. *The Forgotten Path.* Looked less like a path, more like a place you needed a tank to get through.

He hitched his pack higher. Straps dug in. *Left foot, right foot. Simple.* The thrill was gone. Replaced by blisters and the urgent need for a shower. This was pure stubbornness now. He was alone. Miles from anywhere. Every cracking twig made him jump. His hand gripped the machete tighter. Sweat made the handle slick. *Probably just a monkey.* *Right?* He remembered the old missionary's note: *"Guardians unseen..."* *Nope. Not thinking about that. Stress. Lack of sleep. Too much bad coffee.*

He tried scrambling up a muddy slope. Boots slid. He grabbed a root. It ripped out. He landed hard on his backside. Mud everywhere. *Perfect.* He swore, loud enough to startle a bird nearby. Found a better grip. Hauled himself up, breathing hard. *See? The jungle actively dislikes me.*

But moving deeper, things felt... off. The air got thicker. Static crackled, raising the hair on his arms. The non-stop bug chorus faded. Replaced by a low hum. He felt it in his teeth. Even the plants looked weird. Vines twisted in perfect spirals. Leaves arranged like patterns. *Okay, that's not normal.* He tried to ignore it. *Tired. Seeing things.* 

But the feeling stuck. Part scientist, part scared hiker. He felt like he was trespassing. Walking into somewhere ancient. Somewhere waiting.

The map, the whispers, the sheer bloody-mindedness – they pushed him on. Towards the secret. Towards the 'stone seeds'. The climb got steeper. The air cooled, strangely. The hum got louder, vibrating through the soles of his boots now, a deep thrumming from the earth itself.

He pushed through a thick curtain of hanging moss, expecting more endless green. He stopped. Dead still.

It wasn't jungle.

Before him, rising impossibly from the tangled floor, was stone. Black, smooth, seamless stone. Part of a wall? A step? It angled upwards, disappearing into the gloom, carved with lines that flowed with an eerie, non-Euclidean geometry that made his head swim. It looked like nothing ever built by human hands.

*What... the hell...?*
