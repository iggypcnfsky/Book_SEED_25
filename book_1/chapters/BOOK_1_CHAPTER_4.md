# Chapter 4: Mateo's Legacy

Blinking against the afterimage burned onto my retinas, I stared up into the darkness where the impossible star map had flared. It was gone. Just smooth, black, impenetrable stone again. Had I imagined it? Hypoxia? Wishful thinking projected onto a ceiling? But the brief, searing intensity felt too real, too detailed. A star map. An *alien* star map, reflected for a heartbeat from a glowing glyph older than dirt. Right. Add 'celestial cartography' to the temple's growing list of WTF features.

My shoulder screamed where I'd hit the wall, my knee throbbed in counterpoint, and the dead flashlight felt mocking in my hand. The giant glyph on the floor resumed its slow, hypnotic pulse, seemingly unaware it had just casually upended several millennia of astronomical understanding. *Okay, Alex,* I told myself, trying to inject some calm into the adrenaline fizzing through my veins. *Deep breaths. You found the lost temple. You found the magic symbol. You found... whatever the hell that was. Mission accomplished? Now, how about the 'not dying alone in the dark' part of the plan?*

The truth hit me harder than the wall had. This discovery wasn't just big; it was colossal, terrifyingly so. And I was one clumsy, injured academic with a busted flashlight, rapidly dwindling protein bars, and precisely zero backup. The intricate carvings, the humming energy, the Seed glyph, the star map... it wasn't just history. It felt... active. And maybe not entirely friendly. Stumbling around in here alone felt less like exploration and more like poking a sleeping god with a sharp stick. My meticulous research had gotten me here, but it hadn't prepared me for *this*. I needed someone who understood this place, this jungle, in a way no textbook ever could. I needed local knowledge. I needed a guide. I needed Mateo Cruz.

Getting *out* of the temple was almost as fraught as getting in. Guided only by the faint, mocking glow of the glyphs, feeling my way along the unnervingly smooth walls, every shadow seemed to writhe, every echo sounded like pursuit. My knee was on fire, forcing a limping, agonizingly slow pace. By the time I stumbled back out into the comparatively blinding, noisy chaos of the jungle, blinking against the sudden onslaught of natural light and sound, I felt like I'd aged a decade. The air, thick and humid, felt blessedly normal after the sterile, static cold inside. Normal, and full of things that wanted to bite me.

The trek back to the nearest semblance of civilization – the village where my pre-trip digging suggested Mateo Cruz resided – was a blur of pain, paranoia, and pathetic survival attempts. I drank filtered stream water that still tasted suspiciously earthy, ate the last of my squashed energy bars, and tried very hard not to trip over every single root reaching out like a skeletal hand. The jungle felt different now, knowing what lay hidden in its depths. More watchful. Less neutral.

Mateo Cruz was precisely where village whispers had placed him, outside a sturdy-looking home, mending a tool with quiet concentration. He wasn't what I expected – no grizzled adventurer type. Just a man, weathered by the sun and ingrained with a deep, unassuming competence. His eyes, when they flicked up to assess the dusty, limping gringo interrupting his work, were sharp and missed nothing.

"Señor Castillo?" He didn't sound surprised. News travels fast, even without cell service. Or maybe I just looked exactly like the kind of lost cause that washes up periodically.

"You know who I am?"

A slight nod. "Word came from Oaxaca. The archaeologist asking questions." He returned his attention to the tool. "You look like you found more than you bargained for."

Understatement of the century. "I found a site," I said, keeping my voice level, trying not to sound like the raving lunatic I currently felt like. "Old. Very old. Deep in the jungle. Difficult terrain." I gestured vaguely. "I need someone who knows the paths. Someone reliable."

He tested the tool's edge with his thumb, considering. "The jungle holds many places. Some are sacred. Some are dangerous. Some are both." He looked at me again, his gaze steady. "Why this particular place?"

"Academic interest," I lied, poorly. The image of the star map flashed in my mind. "It's... unique. Predates known Zapotec settlements."

Mateo grunted, a noncommittal sound that echoed the jungle's ambiguity. "Things older than the Zapotec are best left undisturbed. My grandfather used to say, 'Don't wake the stones that sleep.'"

"I just need to document it," I insisted, hoping I sounded more convincing than I felt. "Map the location, photograph the structure. Carefully. Respectfully."

He was silent for a long moment, studying me, the jungle, the tool in his hands. Then, he slowly nodded. "I know the areas you mean, though perhaps not this specific structure. The paths are difficult, yes. Especially for outsiders." He named his fee. It was steep, but frankly, he could have asked for my left kidney, and I'd have considered it. "I will guide you. Keep you from breaking your neck." He paused, his expression serious. "But understand, Señor Castillo. I guide you on the path. What you find at the end of it... that is your own burden. And the jungle remembers those who do not show respect."

Relief washed over me, so potent it almost buckled my good knee. "Thank you, Mateo. Agreed."

He gave another slow nod, setting the tool aside. "We leave at dawn. Rest now. You will need it."

As I limped away to find somewhere to collapse for a few hours, Mateo's final words echoed in my ears. *The jungle remembers.* Looking back towards the impenetrable green wall, towards the impossible structure humming in the darkness, I had a sinking feeling he wasn't just talking about respecting ancient ruins.
