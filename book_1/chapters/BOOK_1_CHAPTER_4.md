# Chapter 4: Mateo's Legacy & A Friend in Need

Blinking against the ghost image of alien constellations burned onto my retinas, I stared up into the impenetrable blackness where the star map had flared. Gone. Just smooth stone. *"Did you get that, Kai?"* I whispered, voice hoarse.

*"Got *what*?"* Kai sounded bewildered. *"The energy flare overloaded my optical sensors for 1.3 seconds. All I recorded was the visual equivalent of staring directly into the sun, followed by... darkness. What did *you* see? Besides pretty lights?"*

"A map. Stars. Not ours." Had I imagined it? The intensity felt too real.

*"Seriously? A star map? Okay, add 'interstellar cartography' to the 'Things That Shouldn't Exist' list,"* Kai said, processing. *"Rule out hypoxia? Shared hallucination? Or did we just stumble into chapter one of 'Ancient Aliens: The Really Convincing Episode'?"*

My shoulder screamed, my knee throbbed. The dead flashlight felt mocking. The giant glyph pulsed, indifferent. *Okay, Alex. Deep breaths.* "Let's lean towards 'inexplicable ancient artifact' for now," I muttered. "Right now, priority is 'not dying alone in the dark'. Plot a course out. Please tell me the entrance hasn't vanished."

*"Entrance still present and accounted for, remarkably non-vanishingly,"* Kai confirmed. *"Plotting optimal egress path based on floor glyph luminescence... which sounds ridiculous even saying it. Watch your step. Again."*

This discovery was colossal, terrifying. I was one clumsy academic with busted gear. The temple felt active, maybe not friendly. Stumbling around alone felt like poking a sleeping god. *"Or maybe just poking complex, potentially dangerous, definitely alien technology,"* Kai corrected my thoughts. *"Subtle difference."* My research got me here; it didn't prepare me for *this*. I needed someone who understood this jungle, this land, its whispers. I needed Mateo Cruz.

Getting *out* was an agonizing crawl guided by faint glyphs and Kai's patient directions (*"Left at the vaguely threatening spiral, Alex... no, your *other* left..."*). Emerging into the blinding, noisy jungle felt like surfacing from the deep ocean. The humid air, full of biting insects, felt blessedly normal.

"Okay, civilization time," I gasped, leaning against a tree. "Plot course to nearest village – the one intel suggested Mateo Cruz calls home."

*"Plotting... Approximately 18 kilometers through dense primary rainforest with significant elevation changes,"* Kai reported. *"Estimated travel time for standard human: 12 hours. Estimated travel time for you, in your current state, factoring in injury, fatigue, and potential existential dread? Let's just say... pack imaginary snacks."*

The trek back was a blur of pain, paranoia, and Kai's running commentary. *"You know, the ancient Zapotecs established trade routes through these mountains,"* Kai mused as I stumbled over a root. *"Sophisticated network connecting the Oaxaca Valley to the coast. But according to known surveys... none went *this* deep. This area was deliberately avoided. Wonder why? Maybe they knew something."*

"Maybe they didn't have lunatic professors sending them on wild goose chases with possibly alien maps," I retorted, swatting a vine.

*"Or maybe they encountered something that made them build walls around places like Monte Albán not just for defense, but for containment,"* Kai suggested, always pushing. "Monte Albán dates back to 500 BC, Kai. Impressive, built on a flattened mountaintop, likely by Zapotec predecessors. But this temple... it feels orders of magnitude older. Pre-Olmec even?"

*"The stone analysis – or lack thereof – supports 'ridiculously ancient',"* Kai agreed. *"Makes the Olmec colossal heads look like recent kindergarten projects. Which brings us back to the 'who built it?' question. Locals like Mateo might have legends archaeology hasn't unearthed yet."*

Mateo Cruz was exactly where village whispers placed him, outside a sturdy adobe home, mending a worn leather strap with quiet focus. Not the grizzled adventurer type. Just a man, weathered deep by the sun, radiating unassuming competence. His eyes, sharp and missing nothing, flicked up as the dusty, limping gringo approached.

"Señor Castillo?" No surprise. News travels fast. Or maybe I just looked like I'd wrestled a jaguar and lost.

"You know who I am?"

A slight nod. "Word came. The archaeologist asking... unusual questions." He returned to his strap. *"Facial recognition confirms Mateo Cruz, age approximately 55,"* Kai whispered in my ear. *"Local reputation: reliable, knowledgeable, deeply connected to traditional Zapotec ways. Also, apparently, knows you're coming."* "You look like you found trouble," Mateo stated simply.

Understatement. "I found a site," I kept my voice level. "Old. Very old. Deep jungle." I gestured vaguely, wincing. "I need a guide. Someone who knows the paths." *Someone who won't run screaming or try to sacrifice me to the stone gods,* I added silently.

He tested the strap. "The jungle holds many places. Some sacred. Some dangerous. Some best forgotten." He looked at me, gaze steady. "Places older than my ancestors, older than the first corn. Why this place disturbs your studies?"

"Academic interest," I lied poorly, the star map searing my memory. "It's... unique. Predates known sites. Nothing like Monte Albán or Mitla."

Mateo grunted, a sound echoing the jungle's ambiguity. "Things older than the Cloud People are often best left undisturbed. My grandfather taught me: 'Don't wake the stones that sleep.' The earth remembers what they hold."

*"Cloud People – 'Bene Zaa' – the Zapotecs' name for themselves,"* Kai helpfully footnoted. *"His grandfather's warning aligns with local avoidance patterns of this specific region. High probability he knows more than he's letting on."*

"I just need to document it," I insisted, trying to sound convincing. "Map the location, photograph the structures. Carefully. Respectfully." *And maybe figure out if it's a tomb, a temple, or a spaceship.* "I'll pay well."

He was silent, studying me, the jungle, the strap. Then, a slow nod. "I know the areas, though perhaps not this specific structure. The paths are... difficult." He named his fee. Steep, but fair for risking his life with a potentially crazy academic. "I guide you. Keep you from the worst pitfalls." He paused, serious. "But understand, Señor. I guide you *to* the path's end. What waits there... that is your burden. The jungle, the stones... they remember disrespect."

Relief washed over me. "Thank you, Mateo. Agreed."

Another slow nod. He set the strap aside. "Dawn. Rest now. You look like the jungle already chewed you up and spat you out." *"Accurate assessment,"* Kai concurred cheerfully.

As I limped away, Mateo's words echoed. *The jungle remembers.* *Don't wake the stones that sleep.* Looking back at the impenetrable green wall, towards the impossible structure humming in the darkness, I knew he wasn't just talking about folklore.
