# Chapter 5: Carvings Older Than Time

Dawn broke like a poorly set bone. Every muscle protested as I dragged myself upright. My knee felt like rusted hinges, my shoulder throbbed. *"Morning, Sunshine,"* Kai chirped in my ear. *"Or, you know, whatever passes for morning when you feel like you've been trampled by tapirs. Bio-feedback suggests moderate to severe discomfort across 85% of tracked muscle groups. Recommend coffee, painkillers, and maybe reconsidering your life choices."*

"Coffee first," I groaned. But the image of the star map, the glyph's pulse... that was potent. Terror helps too.

Mateo waited, looking serene. He handed me a canteen with refreshing herbal brew and a dense seed-bar. Infinitely better than my lab-food. "Drink. Eat," he commanded quietly. "The path does not wait."

The journey back with Mateo was a masterclass. Where I'd crashed like a wounded boar, Mateo flowed *with* the jungle. His machete whispered. He pointed out ocelot tracks, medicinal orchids, birdsong shifts warning of rain. It wasn't just navigation; it was a conversation.

*"Impressive,"* Kai admitted, analyzing Mateo's movements. *"Efficiency rating: 98.7%. Minimal energy expenditure, maximum terrain negotiation. My predictive pathing algorithms largely concur with his choices, though I would suggest a minor vector adjustment 300 meters ahead to avoid that patch of potentially irritable bullet ants."*

"Let's stick with Mateo's plan," I muttered, trusting the human over the algorithm for once. I tried explaining the impossible geometry to Mateo. He just nodded slowly. "The earth holds secrets, Señor. Power demands respect, not excitement." His focus remained practical – the crumbling ledge, the rustle of a (mostly harmless) snake, crossing a stream.

At the temple cleft, Mateo paused, scanning the unnatural angles, the way jungle *avoided* the stone. He sniffed the air. "Feels... set apart," he murmured. "Like it doesn't belong to the same song." He touched a vine near the entrance. "Even plants hesitate." He looked at me, unreadable. "My grandfather spoke of places the ancient spirits claimed... 'holes in the world'." He shook his head slightly, dismissing folklore, yet the observation resonated. *"Interesting,"* Kai noted. *"'Holes in the world' correlates with several fringe theoretical physics papers on localized spacetime anomalies. And matches the energy readings we're getting. Coincidence? Or ancient observation framed as myth?"*

We entered. The silence, the cold, the hum – just as unsettling. Mateo moved cautiously, senses on high alert. He noted the lack of dust, insects, the sound-absorbing quality.

"This stone," he ran a hand over the glassy wall. "Not from this region. Too smooth. Too... perfect." He tapped it. The sound died instantly. "And the air... hungry for noise."

I led him to the main chamber, the massive floor glyph pulsing. Mateo stopped, profound stillness replacing his usual stoicism. He took in the glyph, the intricate, alien carvings.

"The patterns," he murmured, voice low. "Feel familiar... like echoes of Zapotec weaving-songs, but twisted. Other." He traced a spiral with his eyes. "A story, very old, of the 'Sky Weavers' before the First People. They taught the stars their paths, left patterns holding creation's keys. Always thought... just a tale." His gaze swept the chamber. "Perhaps not." *"Cross-referencing 'Sky Weavers',"* Kai interjected. *"Limited data. Fragmentary oral traditions recorded by early ethnographers. Usually dismissed as creation myths. But the temporal alignment – 'before the First People' – fits our anomaly."*

Ignoring the pain, I knelt by a dense section of wall carvings, pulling out my field kit. Magnifying loupe, high-intensity penlight (working!), digital microscope for my tablet. Mateo watched silently. I analyzed the lines, the lack of any tool marks. No scratches, slips, no evidence of chisels or drills. Impossibly fine, integrated into the stone as if *grown* there.

"Kai, run close-up analysis. Compare structural patterns to known Mesoamerican stonework – Mitla, Teotihuacan, even Olmec basalt carving techniques."

*"Analyzing... Comparing... Negative correlation across all known databases, Alex,"* Kai reported after a moment. *"The precision exceeds anything recorded. No evidence of subtractive carving. The lines appear integral to the material matrix itself. And the material..."* Where small sections had flaked away near the base (likely seismic shifts, not erosion), the exposed crystalline structure beneath wasn't geologically native. The sheer *feel* of its antiquity screamed age.

*"Preliminary thermoluminescence and residual energy dating estimates are... frankly, absurd,"* Kai continued, sounding almost hesitant. *"The error margins are huge given the anomalous energy readings, but we're talking results consistently predating known human presence in the Americas by *tens of thousands* of years. This isn't just pre-Olmec, Alex. This is potentially pre-*human*. At least, pre-known human history."*

"Mateo," I said, voice hoarse, showing him the magnified image, the dating estimates flashing insistently on the tablet. "Look. The structure, the material... it's not just impossibly old. It's older than any known civilization here. Maybe older than... anyone." The weight of it settled in the humming silence. A rupture in history.

Mateo stared at the image, then at the carvings, expression thoughtful, serious. Skepticism gone, replaced by something deeper. He nodded slowly, gaze distant. "Older than time," he whispered, maybe quoting his grandfather. "The stones that sleep." He looked around the vast, humming chamber, then back at me, a new gravity in his eyes. "Señor Castillo... what have you awakened?"
