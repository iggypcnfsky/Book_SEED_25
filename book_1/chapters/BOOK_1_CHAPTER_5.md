# Chapter 5: Carvings Older Than Time

Dawn broke less like a gentle awakening and more like someone ripping off a Band-Aid. Every muscle I owned screamed in protest as I dragged myself upright. My knee felt like rusty hinges forced open, and my shoulder throbbed with dull persistence. But the image of that impossible star map, the memory of the glyph's pulse... that was better than caffeine. Mostly. A healthy dose of terror is also quite motivating, it turns out.

Mateo was waiting, as promised, looking as if he'd slept soundly on a bed of clouds instead of presumably the hard ground. He carried a simple pack and a well-worn machete, his movements economical and sure. He handed me a canteen filled with something faintly herbal and surprisingly refreshing, and a dense, seed-packed energy bar that tasted infinitely better than my processed chemical sticks. "Drink. Eat," he said, his tone leaving no room for argument. "The path does not wait."

The journey back to the temple was entirely different with Mateo leading. Where I had previously crashed and hacked my way through, leaving a trail like a wounded boar, Mateo flowed. He moved with the jungle, not against it. His machete whispered through vines, rarely needing more than a flick of the wrist. He pointed out things I'd completely missed: the almost invisible tracks of a small jungle cat ("Ocelot," he murmured), a cluster of vibrant orchids high in the canopy ("Good for fever, if prepared right"), the subtle shift in birdsong that warned of approaching rain. He walked with a quiet respect for the environment, his steps light, disturbing little. It wasn't just navigation; it was a conversation with the wilderness. My previous 'conquest' of the jungle felt clumsy and loud by comparison.

His pragmatism was a constant anchor. When I started babbling about impossible geometry and humming stones, he just nodded slowly. "The earth holds many secrets, Señor Castillo. Some have power. Power demands respect, not excitement." He wasn't dismissive, exactly, but his focus remained resolutely on the practical – the crumbling ledge ahead, the type of snake whose rustle we heard in the leaves (apparently, the 'mostly harmless' kind, which wasn't entirely comforting), the best place to cross a fast-flowing stream without getting swept away.

When we finally reached the overgrown cleft leading to the temple entrance, Mateo paused. He didn't gasp or show overt surprise at the structure subtly revealed within. Instead, he went still, eyes scanning the unnatural angles, the way the jungle seemed to *avoid* touching the stone. He sniffed the air. "This place feels..." he searched for the word, "… set apart. Like it doesn't belong to the same song as the jungle." He touched a low-hanging vine near the entrance. "Even the plants hesitate." He looked at me, his expression unreadable. "My grandfather spoke of places the ancient spirits claimed, where the air was different. He called them 'holes in the world'." He gave a slight shake of his head, as if dismissing folklore, yet the observation lingered.

We entered together. The sudden silence, the static cold, the familiar low hum – they were just as unsettling the second time, but having Mateo there, calm and alert, made it less terrifying. He moved with cautious grace, his senses seeming to operate on a different level. While I was focused on the glyphs and the grand scale, he noticed smaller details – the lack of dust, the absence of any insect life, the way the stone seemed to absorb sound.

"This stone," he said, running a hand over the wall near the entrance, the same seamless, glassy surface I'd touched. "It is not like the rock of this region. Too smooth. Too... perfect." He tapped it lightly with a knuckle. The sound was dull, absorbed instantly. "And the air... it is hungry for noise."

I led him towards the main chamber, the place with the massive floor glyph. Seeing it again, even knowing what to expect, sent a shiver down my spine. Mateo stopped at the chamber's edge, his usual stoicism momentarily replaced by a look of profound stillness. He took in the pulsating glyph, the intricate, alien carvings covering every surface.

"The patterns," he murmured, his voice lower than usual. "They feel familiar, like fragments of Zapotec weaving-songs, but... twisted. Echoes of something else." He traced a complex spiral with his eyes. "There is a story, very old, about the 'Sky Weavers' who came before the First People. They say the Weavers taught the stars their paths and left patterns on the world that held the keys to creation. Always thought it was just a tale for children." His gaze swept the chamber. "Perhaps not."

Ignoring the pain, I knelt by a section of wall dense with the non-representational carvings. I pulled out my field kit – not for sample-taking, not yet, that felt like sacrilege Mateo might rightly object to – but for close examination. Magnifying loupe, high-intensity penlight (this one worked, thankfully), digital microscope attachment for my tablet. Mateo watched silently as I analyzed the intersection of the carved lines, the tooling marks – or rather, the complete lack thereof. There were no discernible scratches, no slips, no evidence of chisels or drills. The lines were impossibly fine, the patterns integrated into the stone as if they had *grown* there.

More telling was the stone itself, where minute sections had flaked away at the base, likely due to millennia of seismic shifts rather than erosion in this sealed environment. The exposed crystalline structure beneath the smooth surface... it wasn't anything geologically native to Oaxaca, or anywhere else I knew. And the weathering, the patina, the sheer *feel* of its antiquity... it screamed age. Not centuries. Millennia. Easily predating the Olmec, the Maya, the Zapotec themselves. Predating *anyone* we knew of in this hemisphere.

"Mateo," I said, my voice hoarse, showing him the magnified image on the tablet. "Look at this. The structure, the material... it's not just old. It's impossibly old. Older than any known civilization in the Americas by thousands of years."

The weight of that statement settled in the humming silence. This wasn't just a lost temple; it was a rupture in the historical timeline. The work of unknown builders, using unknown techniques, leaving messages in an unknown language, millennia before history supposedly began here.

Mateo stared at the image, then back at the carvings covering the walls, his expression thoughtful, serious. The easy skepticism was gone, replaced by something deeper. He didn't dispute the finding. He simply nodded slowly, his gaze distant. "Older than time," he whispered, perhaps quoting his grandfather again. "The stones that sleep." He looked around the vast, humming chamber, then back at me, a new gravity in his eyes. "Señor Castillo... what have you awakened?"
