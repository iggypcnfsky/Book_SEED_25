# Chapter 14: The Giza Pursuit

Getting onto the Giza Plateau unnoticed is one thing; accessing a currently restricted excavation site bordering the southern edge of Khafre's pyramid complex is another entirely. It required forged permits secured through one of Lena's shadowy academic contacts (at an exorbitant price wired from my dwindling research funds), pre-dawn timing, and Mateo's knack for spotting the blind spots in the Antiquities Police patrols.

"The recent ground-penetrating radar surveys... the ones the ministry is trying to keep quiet?" Lena whispered, her voice tight with excitement as we slipped past a poorly patched section of chain-link fence under the cloak of darkness. "They didn't just show tombs. They indicated extensive, anomalous voids deep beneath this area. Huge interconnected chambers, tunnels... far larger than anyone predicted. Ten times the size of the pyramids themselves, some preliminary reports suggested before they were buried."

My eyebrows shot up. I'd heard whispers, dismissed them as fringe sensationalism fueled by misinterpreted scans. But Lena spoke with conviction. "You think these... voids... connect to the Seed symbol?"

"The resonance patterns Kai detected from your Oaxaca data align eerily well with the energy signatures flagged in the suppressed GPR reports from this specific sector," Lena confirmed, pulling out a small, modified tablet displaying complex waveform graphics overlaid on a schematic of the plateau. "If there's a physical link, a corroborating symbol here in Egypt, it won't be in the public tombs. It'll be deeper. Closer to whatever generated those anomalous readings."

*"Caution advised,"* Kai noted softly in my earpiece. *"Multiple low-frequency acoustic sensors detected within the perimeter. Minimal voice levels recommended. Also detecting increased encrypted communication traffic originating from surveillance points identified yesterday. They are aware of our presence in the vicinity."*

We moved quickly, ducking behind excavation equipment and stacks of limestone blocks, guided by Lena's tablet towards a newly excavated shaft descending vertically into the bedrock. It looked like a standard archaeological dig, maybe searching for minor mastabas, but Lena insisted the GPR anomalies were centered directly below.

"Here," she breathed, pointing towards faint markings on the shaft's rough-hewn wall, barely visible in the dim light filtering from above. Not the Seed glyph itself, but a geometric pattern – interlocking triangles and curves – that echoed the complex designs surrounding the main symbol in Oaxaca. It was subtle, easily missed, almost eroded away. "It's faint, but it's the same design language."

Before I could even process the implications, chaos erupted. The night air split with the *thwip* of silenced projectiles impacting the rock near our heads. High-intensity beams sliced through the darkness, pinning us.

"Contact!" a voice barked – crisp, professional, amplified. Figures emerged from the shadows around the shaft's edge, clad in dark tactical gear, moving with terrifying efficiency. Chronos. And leading them, calm and implacable in the tactical glow, was Marcus Thorne.

"Dr. Castillo. Dr. Petrova. Señor Cruz," Thorne's voice echoed down the shaft, devoid of emotion. "Predictable. Surrender the data and the artifact fragments. Resistance is statistically inadvisable."

There was no time for statistics. Lena reacted instantly, shoving me towards a shadowed crevice at the base of the shaft I hadn't even noticed. "Tunnel! West wall! Go!"

How did she know? Gunfire erupted – not just the silenced shots, but heavier cracks now, presumably from Thorne's team meeting unexpected resistance. Mateo was suddenly beside me, firing a handgun he must have acquired, providing covering fire with surprising accuracy back up the shaft. Thorne's men returned fire, chips of rock spraying around us.

Lena wasn't just hiding; she moved with a fluid, economical grace that spoke of training. She drew a small, flat pistol from an ankle holster and fired two precise shots towards the figures descending ropes into the shaft, forcing them back momentarily. Her expression was cold, focused, utterly detached from the academic persona.

"Mateo, now!" she yelled, grabbing my arm and pulling me into the narrow opening. It wasn't a crevice; it was the entrance to a tunnel, impossibly old, the air thick with the dust of ages.

We scrambled inside, Mateo laying down suppressing fire before diving in after us. The tunnel was narrow, claustrophobic, sloping steeply downwards. Behind us, we could hear Thorne's commands, the sounds of pursuit echoing unnervingly. Thorne wasn't just competent; he was relentless.

"How did you know about this tunnel, Lena?" I gasped, stumbling over loose stones in the near-total darkness, Kai's light from my tablet providing the only illumination.

"Old maps aren't the only kind of research, Castillo," she shot back, navigating the uneven floor with an ease that belied the darkness. "Let's just say some legends about passages beneath the plateau aren't entirely fiction. Keep moving!"

The shared danger was a tangible thing, pressing in on us as much as the rock walls. Every shadow seemed to hold a threat, every distant shout from our pursuers spurred us onward. My academic life felt a million miles away; this was raw survival. I glanced back at Mateo; his face was grim, his eyes fixed on Lena's back as she led us deeper into the earth. He'd seen her reaction, her preparedness, her knowledge of this escape route. The seeds of suspicion, planted earlier, were clearly taking root in the darkness beneath Giza.
