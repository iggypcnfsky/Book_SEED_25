# Chapter 26: The City Chase

The moment I pulled away from Lena, rejecting her touch, the world exploded again. Not with an EMP this time, but with the concussive *thump* of heavy ordinance impacting the corridor behind us. Thorne wasn't waiting.

"He's collapsing the tunnel access behind the vault!" Lena yelled, grabbing my arm again, but this time with raw urgency, not manipulation. "We have maybe sixty seconds before this whole level is sealed!"

Survival instinct overrode the stinging betrayal. We ran, sprinting through the emergency-lit corridors, the sounds of pursuit – heavy boots, shouted commands, the whine of charging weapons – echoing closer. Lena still led, her knowledge of the facility our only hope, however poisoned its source.

She guided us through service hatches, down emergency ladders, bypassing locked-down sectors with codes I suspected came from her Prometheus Initiative past, not Vance's archives. Every step fueled my anger, my confusion. How much of our journey had been predetermined by her faction? Was Vance even the only enemy?

We burst out of a service exit into a cold, sterile loading bay beneath the main institute, the sudden normalcy of parked electric vehicles and stacked supply crates feeling utterly surreal after the high-tech nightmare below. But the normalcy was shattered by the screech of tires outside.

"They anticipated this exit!" Lena cursed, scanning the bay. "Security vehicles converging!"

Suddenly, a figure detached itself from the shadows behind a large hydrogen fuel cell tank. Clad in slightly torn civilian clothes, bruised but moving with grim determination, was Mateo.

"Mateo!" I cried out, relief warring with the fresh agony of Lena's betrayal.

"Señor Castillo," he acknowledged, his eyes flicking briefly, coldly, towards Lena. "There was… another way out. Less direct." He held up a small, smoking device – clearly Chronos tech, likely stripped from a guard. "Caused a diversion. Bought some time." He gestured towards an electric delivery van parked near the bay doors. "Keys are inside. Let's go. Now."

There was no time for explanations, no time for accusations. We piled into the van, Mateo driving with fierce concentration, Lena calling out directions based on real-time traffic and surveillance data pulled by Kai, while I sat numbly in the back, the weight of the tablet and Lena's treachery pressing down on me.

We shot out of the loading bay just as Chronos tactical vehicles swarmed the area. The chase was on.

Geneva's orderly streets became a high-tech battlefield. Thorne, undoubtedly recovered from the EMP and coordinating furiously, threw everything at us. Traffic lights turned red against us. Bridges raised unexpectedly. Automated bollards erupted from the pavement. Black sedans, driven with chilling precision, tried to box us in, their occupants firing weapons that shattered the van's reinforced windows.

*"Multiple aerial drones detected!"* Kai announced, its voice strained. *"Attempting facial recognition lock! Recommend evasive maneuvers! Thorne is coordinating ground and air assets!"

Mateo drove like a man possessed, weaving through traffic, taking impossible turns down narrow cobblestone alleys in the Old Town, using his innate understanding of terrain and escape even in this alien urban environment. Lena, despite the circumstances, worked seamlessly with Kai, rerouting our path, deploying countermeasures Kai devised – localized signal jamming, exploiting blind spots in the city's surveillance grid.

Their forced cooperation was jarring. Enemies united by a common threat. But the tension was palpable. During a brief lull caught in traffic near the Jet d'Eau, I finally rounded on Lena.

"Prometheus Initiative? Aris Thorne? Was any of it real, Lena? Or was I just the key to unlock your faction's prize?"

"It's not that simple, Alex!" she shot back, her eyes flashing defensively as Mateo expertly maneuvered around a stalled tram. "Yes, I needed the data! It's the only counter-measure to Vance's cascade! But Vance *is* the enemy! My faction… we saw the danger in his approach years ago! We tried to create safeguards!"

"Safeguards? Or your own path to power?" I countered, bitterness coating every word.

"They're coming! Left flank!" Mateo cut in, swerving violently to avoid a collision with a black sedan that appeared out of nowhere.

*"Drone overhead acquiring targeting lock!"* Kai warned.

"Take the Mont Blanc bridge! Head towards the international district!" Lena ordered, overriding my anger with tactical necessity. "We need cover! Lose them in the diplomatic sector!"

We raced through the heart of Geneva, past the grand buildings housing international organizations, symbols of peace and diplomacy serving as the backdrop for our desperate flight. Thorne's pursuit was relentless, technologically superior, fueled by cold fury. Trust was shattered, alliances broken, leaving only the raw, primal need to escape the closing net, even if it meant relying on the very person who had led us into the trap.
