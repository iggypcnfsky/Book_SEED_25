# Chapter 28: Burning Bridges

The concrete labyrinth of the parking garage echoed with the approaching sounds of pursuit – tactical boots on pavement, clipped commands, the slide of weapons being checked. Splitting up felt counterintuitive, like scattering cockroaches when someone turns on the light, but it was the only plan we had that didn't involve surrendering or trusting Lena further than absolutely necessary.

"Alright, diversion," I muttered, crouching with Mateo behind a ridiculously oversized luxury SUV. "Any bright ideas that don't involve accidentally blowing ourselves up? My expertise runs more towards Late Classic Zapotec pottery, not urban warfare."

Mateo surveyed the scene with unnerving calm, pulling the small, smoking Chronos device he'd acquired earlier from his pocket. "This emits a focused sonic pulse. Used for crowd control, breaching. If I overload the charge cycle… it should create a significant concussive blast and localized electrical surge. Enough noise and chaos to draw them towards the south exit ramp."

"Should?" I echoed. "'Should' is doing a lot of heavy lifting today." I risked a glance around the pillar. Chronos operatives, moving in pairs, methodically swept through the garage level below us.

Just then, the elevator doors *dinged* open nearby. A portly businessman in an expensive suit, talking loudly into his phone about derivatives, stepped out, blinking in the dim light. He saw the armed operatives advancing, saw us crouching behind the SUV, and froze, his face slack with bewildered terror. Perfect. Nothing adds authenticity to chaos like a genuinely terrified civilian.

"Now, Señor!" Mateo hissed, shoving the overloading device under the SUV's chassis and pulling me back just as the businessman let out a strangled yelp.

Mateo triggered the device remotely. It didn't explode in a fireball, but erupted with a deafening *CRACK* and a wave of pressure that slammed us against the concrete wall. The SUV bucked violently, its lights flashed erratically, and sparks showered from the ceiling panels above. Alarms, different from the facility ones, started blaring – car alarms, fire suppression warnings. The businessman screamed, dropping his phone and scrambling back towards the elevator, adding beautifully to the general pandemonium.

"*Move!*" Mateo yelled, pulling me towards the emergency stairwell as Chronos operatives predictably converged on the source of the blast near the south ramp.

Meanwhile, Lena, guided by Kai, was executing her part. *"Acquiring vehicle,"* Kai reported coolly in my earpiece over the din. *"Accessing city transit authority network… Identifying low-priority maintenance vehicle – electric street sweeper, model 7B – currently parked three blocks north. Remotely disabling GPS tracker and activating ignition sequence. Optimal rendezvous point calculated: Service alley behind the Brasserie Lipp."

A street sweeper. Seriously? Sometimes, escape wasn't glamorous.

We sprinted through the stairwell, emerging into the relative quiet of a higher garage level, then down another flight into the designated service alley. Lena was already there, standing beside the incongruously large, bright orange street sweeper, looking thoroughly unimpressed with her chariot.

But relief was short-lived. As we scrambled towards the vehicle, a black Chronos sedan screeched into the alley entrance, blocking our escape. Thorne himself stepped out, flanked by two guards, his expression radiating cold fury. He'd anticipated this rendezvous point, or perhaps Lena's tracker, still active despite Kai's efforts, had led him straight to us.

"Going somewhere, Dr. Petrova? With company property?" Thorne asked, raising his weapon.

There was no time. Lena reacted instantly, shoving her own tablet – the one containing her analysis, her contacts, Kai's decryption of *her* specific Prometheus data key derived from the Legacy Archives – into my hands.

"Alex, take it!" she yelled. Then, she turned back towards the street sweeper, pulled open a side maintenance panel I hadn't noticed, and ripped out a cluster of wires connected to its main power core. Sparks flew violently.

"Lena, what are you--?"

"A necessary sacrifice!" she shouted back, just as Thorne opened fire. She dove behind the bulky vehicle as plasma bolts impacted its side. "Kai! Emergency power discharge! Direct overload, target Thorne's position! Burn everything!"

*"Executing emergency discharge! Warning: This will create a massive electromagnetic pulse, corrupting all nearby unsecured electronic data, including potentially the Prometheus key data on Dr. Petrova's tablet now in your possession!"* Kai warned urgently.

It was a desperate gamble. Create a massive EMP to disable Thorne and his men, covering our escape, but potentially destroying the very data Lena had manipulated us to retrieve. Her own hidden agenda, sacrificed for collective survival. Or was it another calculation?

The street sweeper's internal mechanisms screamed, lights pulsed wildly, and then an invisible hammer blow slammed outwards. The air crackled. Thorne and his men were thrown back against their vehicle as their weapons sparked and died. The sedan's lights flickered out. The alley lights overhead popped and extinguished.

"Go! Through the brasserie! Now!" Lena screamed, already sprinting towards the restaurant's back door, leaving the sparking, dying street sweeper behind.

We plunged into the sudden chaos of the Brasserie Lipp's kitchen – startled chefs, clattering pans – then out into the main dining room, weaving through startled patrons, before bursting onto the boulevard outside, vanishing into the nighttime crowds just as sirens began converging on the alley.

We had escaped Thorne's immediate grasp, burning bridges both physical and digital. But Lena's primary objective, the specific data key she needed, might now be corrupted digital dust on the tablet I clutched, thanks to her own desperate act. Her agenda was crippled, unresolved. And as we melted into the Geneva night, fugitives once more, I couldn't help but wonder if sacrificing her prize was the last move in a game I still didn't fully understand.
