# Chapter 11: Cairo Calling

The air in the cheap Giza motel room tasted like dust, diesel fumes, and desperation. Outside, the relentless Cairo traffic blared, a world away from the oppressive silence of the Oaxacan jungle we'd barely escaped days ago. Days? Felt like years. Mateo, propped up on a lumpy mattress, was tending to the still-healing gash on his side with grim determination, the poultices replaced with antiseptic wipes and bandages scavenged from a local pharmacy. His resilience was humbling, but the lines of strain around his eyes mirrored my own exhaustion. We were fugitives hiding in plain sight, two guys nursing injuries and bad coffee, haunted by impossible artifacts and professional killers. Point of no return, indeed.

*"Still no response from Dr. Petrova's academic or personal network relays,"* Kai announced from my battered tablet, screen dimmed to preserve power. *"Potential reasons include: message filtered as spam, recipient deceased, recipient actively ignoring communications from desperate archaeologists clinging to fringe theories, recipient currently being eaten by badgers..."*

"Thanks, Kai. Really needed the badger scenario," I muttered, rubbing my temples. Sending that message felt like a Hail Mary pass into a black hole. Lena Petrova. Brilliant, yes. Groundbreaking symbologist, absolutely. Also, professionally radioactive after her theories on cross-cultural symbol transmission got her laughed out of academia years ago. Theories that, if memory served, flirted dangerously close to the kind of universal patterns the Seed symbol represented. We hadn't exactly parted on the best terms after I cautiously distanced myself from her more... *speculative* work during a conference panel. Calling her now felt like admitting she might have been right all along, which was almost as terrifying as being hunted by Chronos.

"This doctor, Señor Castillo," Mateo said quietly, breaking the silence. He winced slightly as he adjusted a bandage. "You are certain she can be trusted? This path... it attracts danger."

"Certain? No," I admitted. "But her work... it's the closest anyone has come to analyzing symbols like the Seed without dismissing them outright. She's unconventional. Maybe even reckless. Right now, reckless brilliance feels like our best bet." If she even answered.

*"Incoming encrypted message,"* Kai suddenly chirped, the tone shifting slightly. *"Source authentication traces to a private server associated with... ah. Dr. Lena Petrova. Well, speak of the devil and she emails you back."*

My stomach tightened. I tapped the screen, revealing the message. It was short, sharp, and pure Lena.

> *Castillo,*
>
> *Oaxaca? Pre-dynastic Egypt? Still chasing phantoms, I see. Your timing, as usual, is atrocious. The fact you're referencing Giza and 'extreme danger' suggests you've kicked over a rock far bigger than your usual academic squabbles. Against my better judgment, and purely because the potential intersection of Oaxacan anomalies with Naqada III period iconography is too academically perverse to ignore, I will entertain this absurdity.*
>
> *Be at the entrance to the Khan el-Khalili souk, main gate off Al-Muizz Street, noon tomorrow. Come alone initially. If you bring trouble, I vanish. If you waste my time, I bill you.*
>
> *LP*

I read it twice. No warmth, no pleasantries. Just cynicism laced with undeniable, sharp-edged curiosity. That "academically perverse" line was pure Lena – finding intellectual stimulation in the most dangerous corners. And the demand to come alone... smart, cautious. Or manipulative.

*"High-risk, high-reward profile confirmed,"* Kai noted dryly. *"Analysis of phrasing suggests significant personal risk assessment balanced by extreme professional curiosity. Also, probable lingering resentment regarding past academic disagreements. Proceed with caution. And perhaps bring cash for billing purposes."*

"She agreed," I told Mateo, a surge of something akin to hope mixing with apprehension. "She'll meet us. In Cairo tomorrow."

Mateo nodded slowly, his eyes thoughtful. "Khan el-Khalili. Crowded. Good place to meet, or to disappear. She is careful." He met my gaze. "Be careful, Señor. Some trails are best left cold."

He was right. Contacting Lena felt like throwing gasoline on a fire. She was brilliant, yes, but also a wildcard, someone whose past work was deemed too controversial, too *out there*. And Chronos was still out there, hunting us. Vance, Thorne... they wouldn't have stopped at the jungle's edge. They'd follow the whispers, the data trail. Bringing Lena into this could paint an even bigger target on all our backs.

But what choice did we have? The symbols connected Oaxaca and Egypt. Lena Petrova might be the only person alive capable of seeing the bridge between them. Tossing the empty coffee cup aside, I looked out the grimy window towards the distant, hazy outline of the pyramids, ancient titans standing silent against the modern chaos. We were stepping into another labyrinth, armed with fragmented knowledge and pursued by shadows. And now, we had a potential new player entering the game – one whose own agenda remained dangerously unclear. Tomorrow couldn't come soon enough, and I already dreaded it.
