# Chapter 6: Unseen Watchers

Mateo's question hung heavy in the humming air: *"What have you awakened?"* It echoed off the silent carvings. Awakened? Felt more like I'd stumbled into a slumber party for elder gods and accidentally kicked the biggest one. Mateo's grim look confirmed it: the easy trail camaraderie was gone, replaced by a shared sense of standing on a crumbling edge. His skepticism had yielded to a deep, ancestral caution that felt far more appropriate than my buzzing academic excitement.

*"Technically,"* Kai interjected helpfully, *"based on current energy readings and lack of observable movement, 'awakened' might be premature. 'Poked insistently' seems more accurate. Though the potential consequences remain... problematic."*

"Thanks, Kai. Comforting as always." We spent the next few days in tense, hyper-focused activity. Mostly me. Armed with tablet, camera, sketching tools, and Kai running constant analysis, I dove into documenting everything. Every glyph photographed, every pattern sequence sketched and cross-referenced by Kai against global databases (still zero matches), every impossible angle measured digitally. It felt like deciphering fragments of a cosmic Rosetta Stone. My injuries became background noise.

Mateo, however, was possessed by vigilance. While I hunched over glowing symbols, he moved like a phantom around the perimeter. Not guiding; guarding. His focus wasn't the ancient stone, but the jungle pressing in. He'd pause, listening intently, head cocked, eyes scanning. Sometimes, mundane monkeys. Other times... nothing. Just silence. An unnatural, expectant silence. *"Ambient sound levels are consistently lower than baseline jungle noise profiles for this region and time of day,"* Kai confirmed quietly one afternoon. *"Significantly lower. Something is actively suppressing or deterring local fauna."*

"The jungle is quiet," Mateo murmured then, near the entrance. "Too quiet. Insects hold their breath."

I almost dismissed it, lost in a baffling glyph sequence. "Weather?" *Or maybe,* Kai offered dryly, *the local critters are just as freaked out by the humming space bunker as we are. Smart critters.*

Mateo didn't argue, just gave me that long look before melting back into the shadows. But his unease was contagious. The sense of being watched grew from a prickle to a certainty. The silence felt less like peace, more like active surveillance. Shadows deepened unnaturally. Twigs snapped just beyond sight.

Proof came from Mateo. Scouting a wider perimeter, he returned not with animal track reports, but with something small, metallic, cradled carefully.

"Se√±or Castillo," his voice low, tight. "Look."

It looked like a dull grey rock, mottled with fake lichen. Until Mateo scraped away the camouflage, revealing a tiny, smoked-glass lens. The underside was molded composite casing, smooth, dark, with minuscule seams and a power contact.

*"Well, hello there,"* Kai breathed digitally as I held it up for my wrist-cam. *"Running analysis... High-density composite casing, micro-optic lens with variable aperture, likely contains audio pickup and multi-spectrum sensor package. Power signature suggests sophisticated battery or induction charging. Definitely not local tech, Alex. This is military-grade, or higher. Very high-end surveillance hardware."*

"Found it tucked in Ceiba roots," Mateo said, eyes hard. "Overlooking the path. It is not rock." He pointed to faint adhesive residue. "Not old. Months? Weeks? Not jungle-made."

My blood ran cold. A camouflaged sensor. Someone knew. Someone with resources, tech, secrecy. Planted *before* I got here? Or had they tracked me? *"Impossible to say without analyzing network traffic, which is non-existent here,"* Kai said. *"But its placement suggests long-term monitoring, predating your arrival."*

The quiet felt suffocating. The silence wasn't the jungle's; it was electronic. Watching.

The next discovery solidified the fear. Packing gear near dusk, Mateo suddenly grabbed my arm, pulling me back against the cold temple wall, hand clamped over my mouth. He pointed silently towards the narrow pathway away from the entrance. For a split second, between two trees thirty yards out, a faint, horizontal red line shimmered, then vanished.

*"Laser tripwire confirmed,"* Kai stated instantly, voice stripped of humor. *"Part of a perimeter security grid. Sophisticated emitter/receiver setup, likely linked to the sensor network. We're not just being watched, Alex. We're inside a cage."*

We didn't need to discuss it. The implications crashed down. We weren't alone. The whispers leading me here... bullshit. Someone else knew. Someone advanced, well-funded. The silent jungle wasn't just watching; it was wired. We hadn't just stumbled onto an ancient mystery; we'd walked into someone else's high-tech surveillance grid. Judging by the hardware, our watchers played for keeps. Mateo's question echoed, terrifyingly relevant. *What have you awakened?* It wasn't just the stones anymore. We'd awakened *them*.
