# Character Profile: Dr. Lena Petrova

## Basic Information
- **Name:** Dr. Lena Petrova
- **Role:** Supporting Character (Book 1: The Stone of Origins) - Expert Linguist/Symbologist
- **Occupation:** Formerly a respected academic linguist/symbologist, now potentially working independently or in obscurity.

## Physical Description
- *(To be determined - perhaps suggesting intense focus, maybe slightly disheveled from intense research, likely older than Ava)*

## Personality Traits
- **Positive:** Brilliant, analytical, sees patterns others miss, dedicated to her field (even if ostracized), potentially witty or dry sense of humor.
- **Negative:** Can be abrasive, cynical, distrustful (due to past experiences), impatient with conventional thinking, potentially holds grudges (maybe against Ava or the academic establishment).
- **Quirks:** *(To be determined - e.g., specific research habit, reliance on caffeine, a particular phrase)*

## Background & History
- Was once a promising academic, possibly a mentor, colleague, or rival to Ava.
- Her career was likely derailed or stalled due to pursuing controversial theories, perhaps related to diffusionism, ancient astronauts, or interpretations of symbols that challenged mainstream thought (potentially touching on early Seed concepts).
- May have published discredited papers or faced ridicule, leading her to withdraw from the academic community.
- Ava seeks her out because Lena's unconventional expertise is uniquely suited to the strange inscriptions found in the temple.

## Motivations & Goals
- **Primary Motivation:** Initially, perhaps intellectual curiosity, a chance to validate her past theories, or even a degree of resentment/desire to show up her former peers.
- **Evolving Goal:** Becomes genuinely invested in the mystery and significance of the Seed symbol; recognizes the danger and feels a responsibility to help decipher it correctly; potential for personal redemption.

## Conflicts
- **Internal:** Battling cynicism and past bitterness; deciding whether to trust Ava and risk further ridicule or danger; confronting the possibility that her wildest theories might be true.
- **External:** Potential friction with Ava over methodology, past grievances, or personality clashes; targeted by the same shadowy organization pursuing Ava; navigating the dangers associated with the discovery.

## Character Arc (Book 1)
- Starts as a reluctant, possibly bitter, expert contacted out of desperation.
- Gradually thaws as the evidence mounts and her expertise proves crucial.
- Reclaims some sense of purpose and potentially earns redemption in her own eyes, if not the world's.
- Learns to collaborate and trust again, contributing vital pieces to the puzzle.

## Relationships
