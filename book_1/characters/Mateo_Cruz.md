- **Role:** Supporting Character (Book 1: The Stone of Origins) - Ava's Local Guide
- **Occupation:** Ecotourism guide, local historian (informal), expert naturalist.

## Physical Description
- *(To be determined - consider features suggesting resilience, experience in the outdoors, perhaps mid-40s)*

## Personality Traits
- **Positive:** Resourceful, pragmatic, deeply knowledgeable about Oaxacan wilderness and local Zapotec lore, loyal (once trust is earned), calm under pressure, protective of his heritage and land.
- **Negative:** Initially skeptical (bordering on dismissive) of outlandish theories, cautious, can be reserved or stoic, wary of outsiders.

## Background & History
- Descendant of local Zapotec communities. Grew up exploring the mountains and valleys of Oaxaca.
- Inherited a deep respect for the land and its history, though he views ancient stories more as folklore than literal truth initially.
- Runs a small, independent guiding service, often taking researchers or adventurous tourists into remote areas.
- Has likely seen strange things in the wilderness before but explained them away through natural causes.

## Motivations & Goals
- **Primary Motivation:** Ensure Ava navigates the terrain safely and respects the local environment/potential sacred sites. Earn a living.
- **Evolving Goal:** Protect Ava from tangible threats (environmental, human antagonists) as the danger becomes clear; begins to question his own skepticism as he witnesses events unfold; protect the secrets of the region from exploitation.

## Conflicts
- **Internal:** Wrestling with the mounting evidence that contradicts his pragmatic worldview; balancing his duty to Ava with the potential danger to his community or himself.
- **External:** Navigating treacherous terrain and natural dangers; potential conflict with the shadowy organization alongside Ava; dealing with suspicious locals or authorities; friction with Ava over her more esoteric interpretations vs. his grounded approach.
