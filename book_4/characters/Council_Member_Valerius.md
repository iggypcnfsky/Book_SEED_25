## Basic Information
- **Name:** Valerius (Title: Council Member / Chairman)

- **Affiliation:** Leader of the traditionalist faction / Representative of established power structures (e.g., Old City Council, Energy Consortium).

## Personality Traits
- **Positive:** Strong leader (for his faction), defender of tradition (as he sees it), politically savvy, eloquent opponent.

- **Quirks:** *(To be determined - specific political rhetoric, attachment to old symbols of power)*

## Background & History
- *(To be determined - Long career in the pre-arcology power structure? Ties to industries threatened by the arcology (e.g., fossil fuels, traditional construction)?)*
- Sees Kian Aria's arcology not as progress, but as a dangerous, destabilizing force that threatens the established social order and his own influence.
- Genuinely believes the arcology's potential influence on consciousness or society is unnatural or undesirable.

## Motivations & Goals
- **Primary Motivation:** Stop the arcology project or severely limit its influence and replication.
- **Goal:** Preserve the existing power structure and social order; discredit Kian Aria and the arcology concept; maintain control over resources and populace.
- **Methods:** Political maneuvering, spreading fear and misinformation (FUD), regulatory obstruction, inciting public opposition, potentially sabotage (plausible deniability).

## Conflicts
- **With Protagonist (Kian):** Represents the ideological and political opposition to Kian's vision. Works to undermine the project and Kian's reputation.
- **Internal:** Maintaining unity within his own diverse coalition of anti-arcology groups (some fear tech, some fear loss of power, some fear the biological integration).
- **External:** Convincing the wider populace that the familiar status quo is preferable to the arcology's radical promise.

## Resources & Abilities
