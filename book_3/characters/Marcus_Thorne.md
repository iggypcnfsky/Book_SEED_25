## Basic Information
- **Name:** Marcus Thorne
- **Role:** Primary Antagonist (Book 3: Echoes in the Helix)
- **Affiliation:** CEO of HelixCorp (or similar powerful biotech corporation).
- **Occupation:** Corporate Executive / Bio-Capitalist.

## Physical Description
- *(To be determined - perhaps impeccably dressed, projecting power and control, maybe signs of subtle bio-enhancements)*

## Personality Traits
- **Positive:** Visionary (in a corporate sense), driven, intelligent, persuasive, understands market forces.
- **Negative:** Utterly ruthless, amoral, views genetics purely as a commodity, obsessed with profit and control, disregards ethical boundaries.
- **Quirks:** *(To be determined - specific corporate jargon, obsession with legacy or biological perfection)*

## Background & History
- *(To be determined - How did he build HelixCorp? Previous ethically dubious ventures? Personal motivations for seeking genetic control?)*
- Sees the Seed sequence in DNA discovered by Dr. Mbeki as the ultimate product â€“ the key to controlling human evolution and cornering an unparalleled market.
- Believes ethical concerns are obstacles to progress and profit.

## Motivations & Goals
- **Primary Motivation:** Acquire and monopolize Dr. Mbeki's research and the technology to activate/control the Seed DNA sequence.
- **Goal:** Turn control over human evolution into a marketable product; achieve ultimate corporate dominance; possibly attain personal biological enhancement/immortality.
- **Methods:** Corporate espionage, hostile takeovers (of labs/personnel), legal manipulation, smear campaigns, bribery, potentially kidnapping or assassination.

## Conflicts
- **With Protagonist (Dr. Mbeki):** Views her as an asset to be acquired or an obstacle to be removed. Tries to steal her research and control her discovery.
- **Internal (Corporate):** Potential boardroom rivals, dealing with whistleblowers, managing the potential PR fallout of unethical actions.
- **External:** Competition from other corporations, regulatory bodies (if any effective ones exist).

- Influence over media and political figures.

- Employs skilled corporate operatives.

## Role in Series Arc
- Represents the danger of unchecked capitalism and corporate greed applied to fundamental biological discoveries.
- Embodies the theme of exploiting knowledge for profit rather than understanding or cautious progress.
- HelixCorp, or the technology it develops/steals, could have lasting consequences explored in Books 4 and beyond.

## Notes & Ideas
- Does Thorne want the power for himself, for profit, or for a twisted vision of improving humanity?
- What is HelixCorp's public image vs. its hidden activities?
- How close does he get to controlling the Seed sequence?
